For GGIR, install the GGIR package then everything is easy to follow. The shell function is a handy tool for generating activity reports.
Just follow the instruction I wrote in the read.r file.
Two things I want to reiterate here:
-first, the input file suffix need to be lowercase, e.g. .cwa, the AX3 raw data is.CWA
-second, do not run multiple shell functions at the same time, it will case problem.
For HMM, because it is developed in Unix platform, it is unfriendly to WIN users.
You can use WSL to create a virtual Linux environment. Following the instructions in
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10 step by step. I have pasted the key steps below
a.	Before installing any Linux distros for WSL, you must ensure that the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" optional feature is enabled:
1.	Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
2.	Restart your computer when prompted.
b.	Download the Linux package to a root path on your drive such as ‘C:\ ‘:
I prefer ubuntu 18.04
Ubuntu 18.04: https://aka.ms/wsl-ubuntu-1804
c.	Unzip the file to a root folder using winZIP or whatever software 
d.	Run the .exe file in the unzipped folder
e.	Follow the instruction in the installer 
Once you get your environment ready.
Run the following code in the terminal 
$ git clone git@github.com:activityMonitoring/biobankAccelerometerAnalysis.git <your path>
$ bash utilities/downloadDataModels.sh
$ pip3 install --user .
$ javac -cp java/JTransforms-3.1-with-dependencies.jar java/*.java
Potential problems may occur:
1.	If causing permission error, just using sudo
2.	If git is not working, just download the git from:
https://github.com/activityMonitoring/biobankAccelerometerAnalysis
3.	If model cannot be downloaded, just download from
https://gas.ndph.ox.ac.uk/aidend/accModels/doherty2018.tar
https://gas.ndph.ox.ac.uk/aidend/accModels/willetts2018.tar
and put it to the activityModels folder in the git.
4.	If Javac not found, try update all software using 
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
in the terminal.
For how to use the HMM via terminal:
First, cd to the program path
Then sudo python3 accProcess.py <your data path>
	You can include --epochPeriod=10 to set the epoch time 
All other parameters can be found in the accProcess.py well annotated, just including them as, for example:
sudo python3 accProcess.py --epochPeriod=5 --rawOutput=True <your data path>
To visualized your activity log, just use the command 
python3 accPlot.py <find the -timeSeries.csv.gz file in your data path >  <path to store your figure> 
e.g. 
python3 accPlot.py /mnt/hgfs/VM_Ubuntu/raw_data/005/BW_005_20190114-timeSeries.csv.gz /mnt/hgfs/VM_Ubuntu/raw_data/005/BW_005_20190114.png
To be noticed, if you are using different model, you need to specify the model using in plotting
e.g.
python3 accPlot.py --activityModel=activityModels/willetts2018.tar /mnt/hgfs/VM_Ubuntu/raw_data/007/willets_model/BW_007_20190121-timeSeries.csv.gz /mnt/hgfs/VM_Ubuntu/raw_data/007/willets_model/BW_007_20190121.png
tips: there are many handy functions in the ~/accelerometer/accUtils.py file, try using these functions to interpret the HMM results.
